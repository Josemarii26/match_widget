# match_widget
shows event main markets for given kambi FOOTBALL match ID.
See index.html for example.

# Usage

1. Add this where ever you want to have the list of events for a league:

   ```<eyas-match-container matchId="1019426498" prod="true" loadingText="Loading..." drawText="draw" winText="to win" >No Matches currently avaliable</eyas-match-container>```

2. Add this (or a minified version of it) at the end of the body tag
   ```<script src="./js/match.js"></script>```

3. Add match.js to your project.

Key:

* matchId = kambi league for CTS or prod taken using https://kambi-explorer.eyasgaming.net/
* prod = text to display data from prod or no prod 
* loadingText = text to display while the data is loading
* drawText = text to show next to the draw price.
* winText = text to show after the home or away team.
* inner text = message to display if there are no leagues, or an error occured.
* prod = true or false, false is non prod (different kambi data and points to our UAT site) any other value will be considered true.
