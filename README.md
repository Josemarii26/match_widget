2. Add this (or a minified version of it) at the end of the body tag
   ```<script src="./js/league.js"></script>```

3. Add league.js to your project.

Key:

* leagueId = kambi league for CTS or prod taken using https://kambi-explorer.eyasgaming.net/
* loadingText = text to display while the data is loading
* drawText = text to show next to the draw price.
* winText = text to show after the home or away team.
* inner text = message to display if there are no leagues, or an error occured.
* prod = true or false, false is non prod (different kambi data and points to our UAT site)
